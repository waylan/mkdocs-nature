Theme Variables Search Code Highlighting Theme Variables \u00a7 The theme includes support for a few variables which can be set by the user to control the theme's behavior. theme.icon \u00a7 Point this setting at an image file in your docs_dir to display an icon in your documentation. theme : name : nature icon : icon.png theme.logo \u00a7 Point this setting at an image file in your docs_dir to display logo in your documentation. theme : name : nature logo : logo.png theme.release \u00a7 Use this setting to include the version of the project you are documenting in your documentation. theme : name : nature release : '2.1.3' theme.issue_tracker \u00a7 Assign the URL for your issue tracker to this setting to include a \"Report a Bug\" link on each page. For example, if you use GitHub to track issues: theme : name : nature issue_tracker : https://github.com/user/project/issues repo_url \u00a7 Assign the URL for your repository to this setting to include a link on each page. See MkDocs' documentation for more details. edit_uri \u00a7 When set, an \"edit this page\" link is included on each page. Note that if the repo_url points to either GitHub or Bitbucket, this setting is automatically configured and does not need to be set manually. See MkDocs' documentation for more details. copyright \u00a7 Assign the text to be used as a copyright notice in the footer of each page. For example: copyright : \"Copyright &copy; 2017\" site_author \u00a7 Assign the name to be included with the copyright notice on each page. This setting is ignored if copyright is not also set. Search \u00a7 The MkDocs-Nature theme includes support for MkDocs search plugin. As long as the search plugin is enabled (MkDocs' default), a search page will be generated and included in your site. If you would like to disable search, then disable the search plugin by defining a plugins setting which does not include search . If you have no other plugins, then set plugins to an empty list: plugins : [] Permalinks \u00a7 To enable permalinks to appear when hovering over any page or section headers, you need to enable the relevant configuration setting for the TOC extension of Python-Markdown. markdown_extensions : - toc : permalink : true By default, the pilcrow or paragraph sign (\u00b6) is used for the permalink. If you would like different text, set permalink to your desired string instead of true . For example setting it to \u00a7 would display the section sign. Admonitions \u00a7 The appropriate CSS styles are defined to support the admonition extension to Python-Markdown. To utilize admonitions, enable the extension in your config file: markdown_extensions : - admonition Attention See the Admonition Extension documentation for specifics on the syntax. Code Highlighting \u00a7 By enabling the codehilite extension in your mkdocs.yml config file you get syntax highlighting support using Pygments' Tango theme. Configuration \u00a7 Enable the codehilite extension in your mkdocs.yml config file: markdown_extensions : - codehilite Usage \u00a7 For best results, be sure to identify the language of each code block in your Markdown files. JavaScript Sample \u00a7 For example, by using the following Markdown: ```javascript alert(\"A JavaScript Alert!\"); ``` Your codeblock will render as: alert ( \"A JavaScript Alert!\" ); HTML Sample \u00a7 <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < meta http-equiv = \"Content-Type\" content = \"text/html; charset=utf-8\" /> < title > Hello, World! </ title > </ head > < body > < h1 > Hello, World! </ h1 > </ body > </ html > Python Sample \u00a7 >>> def hello ( name ): ... print u \"Hello, {} !\" . format ( name ) ... >>> hello ( 'World' ) u 'Hello, World!'","title":"Features"},{"location":"features/#features","text":"The MkDocs-Nature theme supports a number of features which are configurable by the end user.
